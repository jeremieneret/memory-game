I made this little memory game using 6 sets of 6 jpg with a filter which changes randomly their hue each new game. 
I had this idea to have infinite possibilities of cards and keep the game very light. 

In a next future, I'm thinking of importing 0 jpg, only use linear-gradient stuffs with CSS & JS, but this time I wanted to test with some files, since the code and even the logic are not the same.

This personal project was about using React before my exams next week :)
